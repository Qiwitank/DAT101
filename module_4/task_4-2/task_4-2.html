      <li>[What is an array?]</li>
      <p>[An array is a type of variable that stores mutiple values in a single place. It's like a list.]</p>
      <li>[What does it mean to "hardcore" when we talk about programming?]</li>
      <p>[To "hardcore" something means writing fixed values directly into the code, instead of calculating 
        or dynamically retrieving them.]</p>
      <li>[Explain in plain text what happpens in task 3, and how we can traverse (iterate) the array
        when we (humans) don't "know" how long the array is.]</li>
      <p>[In task 3, a sentence is used to split into words usinf ".split("")", which turns the string into array
        of words.Then we use two methods, ".every()" and ".forEach()", to go through each word and print its index and
        content. We don't need to know the array's length because these methods handle iteration automatically.]</p>
      <li>[Why is it beneficial to store instances of a class in arrays, as in task 4?]</li>
      <p>[Storing class instances (like "TBook" objects) in an array helps organize related data in a structured way. 
        This makes it easy to loop through them, sort them, or search for specific objects. It's more powerful than using
        separate variables for each book.]</p>
      <li>[Try your best to explain EWeekDays object from task 7. How do we use the "value" attribute, for example?
        In what way do "WeekDay", "Workdays", which would contain "Monday", "Wednesday", and "Thursday", how would
        it ideally look?]</li>
      <p>["EWeekDays" os an object that uses binary values to represent days of the week, which lets you combine days using bitwise
        operations. The "value" attribute is a unique number for each day. "Workdays" combines several days (Mon-Fri) by adding their values. 
        An ideal "Workdays" array might look like "[EWeekDays.WeekDay1, EWeekDays.WeekDay3,EWeekDays.WeekDay4]" for Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday.]</p>
      <li>[In task 8, we will use a "callback" routine when sorting. Explain how such a "callback" woutine works.]</li>
      <p>[A callback is a function passed into another function. In sorting, the callback decides the order of elements. The "sortRandomValues" function
        compares two numbers at a time and returns a value that tells ".sort()" which one should come first.]</p>
      <li>[What happens in the sorting routines you have created? try to explain how the array can figure out if an element should come before
        of after another. The best wat to answer this is to print both parameters each time the sorting routine runs.]</li>
      <p>[In the sort routine, JavaScript compares two elements at a time. The callback returns a negative number if the first
        should come before the second, zero if they're equal, and a positive number if it should come after. You can add a "console.log(aValue1, aValue2)" in the
        callback to see the comparisons.]</p>
      <li>[In task 10, we will create an array with rows and columns. Explain what the first element of the array contains.]</li>
      <p>[The first element of the "myTable" array is another array (the first row), and it contains strings like ""0,0","0,1", up to "0,8"", representing cells
        in that row. It's basically a table structure: an array of arrays.]</p>
