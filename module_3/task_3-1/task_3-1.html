      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>[If the wake up time is 7, the answer “I can catch the bus to school” pops up.]</p>
      <li>Same as question #1. How ever the answer should now be different. Discuss the behaviour of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>[If the wake up time is 8, I get two answers up: “if I wake up at 7 o’clock I can take the bus, if not I have to take the train.”
         And “if I wake up at 8 o'clock I can take the train, otherwise I have to take the car”]</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p>[If the wake up time is 6, then the answer is “I can take the bus to school”.
        If the wake up time is 9, then i get the answer “if I wake up at 7 o’clock I can take the bus, if not I have to take the train.”]</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
      <p>[If the number is “0”, then I get the answer “zero”.]</p>
