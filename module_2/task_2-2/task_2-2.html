      <li>Where should you use constants, and where should you use variables? Can they all be constants</li>
      <p>
				[Constant is used for when you need to use "const" and the value of const can't be changed. For variables you use "let" for when a value van be changed. They cannot all be constants if there is a value that can be changed..]
			</p> 
      <li>How do parentheses affect the arithmetic outcome of an expression?</li>
      <p>
				[The parentheses allow us to group numbers and operations so that the expression is calculated in the correct order. It makes it easier to calculate both simple and difficult calculations.]
			</p>
      <li>How do we limit floating-point numbers to a given number of decimals?</li>
      <p>
				[You use the toFixed() method and enter a number in the parentheses with how many decimal places you want.]
			</p>
      <li>How can we compare two floating-point values to see if they are equal (is 12.199999 the same as 12.2)?</li>
      <p>
				[Use the signs "> <" to calculate which number has the highest value.]
			</p>
      <li>What do comparison operators return, and how can we check if they are FALSE or TRUE?</li>
      <p>
				[Comparison operators can compare numbers or strings and carry out evaluations. Comparison operator return either 1 = true or 0 = false. You can use "==" to compare to values, and it will return as wither true or false. ]
			</p>
      <li>How does the Math.random() function work, and what can it be used for?</li>
      <p>
				[Math.Random() returns a random number between 1 - 360, if you were to place those numbers in the function.]
			</p>
      <li>What is modulus (%), and when do we need this operator in mathematical operations?</li>
      <p>
				[(%) returns the remainder of a division, after one number is divided by another.]
